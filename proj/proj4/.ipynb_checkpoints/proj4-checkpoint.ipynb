    "In lecture, we discussed how one could find specific attributes from a JSON object using dot (`.`) notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- While you can still use the dot notation in queries, PyMongo represents documents returned from Mongo queries using Python dictionaries, making it convenient to manipulate JSON using a mix of Mongo queries and array indexing.\n",
    "    - Specifically, given the result of a retrieval `find` query, you can look up the third document by indexing with `[2]`. Note, since we are using Python arrays, we will be using 0-based indexing. Then, given this document, you can look up the field `'amount'` by appending `['amount']` etc., adding multiple square brackets as needed to \"walk down\" the JSON tree representation via `collection.find(...)[2]['amount']`. This will return the `'amount'` field from the 3rd document returned from the query. This combination of query and indexing will be useful in obtaining the necessary information you need for this and other questions.\n",
    "- In order to get a visual output of the query results, you will need to wrap `collection.find(...)` inside `list()`, e.g. `list(collection.find(...))`. This is because `collection.find(...)` returns a **Cursor** object, which is an iterator. **An important consequence** is that if we set `result = collection.find(...)`, then calling `list(result)` for the first time will get you the expected list of documents in the query result, but calling `list(result)` for a second time will give you an empty list! So wrapping `collection.find(...)` directly inside `list()` would avoid this issue. With that in mind, you may not *always* need to obtain a visual output of the results.\n",
    "- Be aware of the distinction of when you are querying with Mongo versus Python-based array indexing into your Mongo query results (i.e. you are wrapping your query inside `list()` and *then* indexing into that list.)\n",
    "- **As a reminder, since we are using Python dictionaries as our query filter, make sure to wrap all keys (and applicable values) inside quotes. Otherwise, errors will occur.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a warmup to get you familiarized with PyMongo syntax in combination with Python-based array indexing, find the **Tuesday hours** for the restaurant named **Legal Sea Foods** at **100 Huntington Ave** in **Boston**. Be careful—there are many Legal Sea Foods in Boston!"

Similar to `collection.find(...)`, `collection.aggregate(...)` also returns a **Cursor** object (which is an iterator).\n",

    "### Question 1e\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's learn Mongo updates, deletions, and creation. Create a new collection called `review_boolean` which is the exact same as `reviews` EXCEPT there is a new field called `to_avoid` which is the ***string*** `\"true\"`  if the review `text` contains the words \"disgusting\", \"horrid\", \"horrible\", \"gross\", \"bad\", or \"hate\" and the ***string*** `\"false\"` if not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tricky task! We have not discussed creation, updates, or insertions in great detail during lecture but luckily, Mongo uses a similar approach to SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Insertions***: In order to insert into a document, you may use the functions [review_boolean.insert_one(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/) or [review_boolean.insert_many(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/). These functions take in a document or a list of documents and inserts them into the collection. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Updates***: In order to update a document, you may use the functions [review_boolean.update_one(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateOne/) or [review_boolean.update_many(...)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateMany/). These functions take in two parameters.\n",
    "1. The first parameter specifies which documents should be modified. For `update_many`, if the first parameter is `{}`, this indicates that all documents should be updated. However, you can add a more specific filter here if you would like.\n",
    "2. The second parameter specifies what you would like to update your field to (the [$set](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/set/) operator may come in handy here). Recall that in our SQL model, updates are performed as `UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE ...`. In our case, the first ellipsis corresponds to `review_boolean`, the second ellipsis corresponds to the second parameter of `update_*` where `*` can be `one` or `many`, and the third ellipsis corresponds to the first parameter of `update_*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Creation***: We handle creation of the collection for you. But in PyMongo, creation of a collection is as simple as writing `variable_name = db[collection_name]` where `db` is the the PyMongo database object variable you have already created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional reminders and hints:\n",
    "- The empty collection `review_boolean` has already been created for you and is stored in the variable of the same name.\n",
    "- A text index has been created for you. You can use a similar search approach as the last question.\n",
    "- We want to start by inserting the documents from the `review` collection into the `review_boolean` collection.\n",
    "- Don't forget that in order to pass the hidden tests, the `to_avoid` field must exist for every document in `review_boolean`! The [$exists](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/exists/) operator may be helpful."

    "So far, we've talked about NoSQL / document databases like Mongo and relational databases like Postgres. Now, we will explore data transformation with a different data model: dataframes. Dataframes are similar to relations; we will dive into the differences here. To this end, we will use Pandas, a Python package that allows us to work with dataframes. Pandas is widely adopted by data scientists for data loading, wrangling, cleaning, and analysis. To start, let us export our MongoDB collections into Pandas using a function called `json_normalize`. We need to truncate\n",

    "Your relatives inform you that they would like to be at the restaurant when it opens to beat the crowds. Furthermore, after gathering their availabilities, most of your relatives would prefer for the meal to be on a Friday and for the start time of the meal to be between 5:00 - 6:59 PM (17:00-18:59). Find the number of restaurants that open on Fridays between 17:00-18:59 and store this in a variable labeled `q4b`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Also, be aware that **`hours` can either be a dictionary or `None`**. Depending on how you write your aggregation pipeline, you may or may not need to explicitly deal with this. Hint: Read the [\\$match](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/) documentation carefully. **What does it automatically filter out?**\n",

    "- Once you have the Friday hours of a particular restaurant, you only need to look at the first time listed. For example, suppose Restaurant A has Friday hours like so: `15:00-16:00`. Restaurant A opens at 15:00, which is outside the range from 17:00-18:59, inclusive. Thus, we would not want to include this in our count. This is because your relatives want to be **at the restaurant when it opens.**\n",
    "- Set up an aggregation pipeline using the [\\$set](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/set/) and [\\$match](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/match/) stage operators. You may also want to use the [\\$split](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/split/) operator to parse out the Friday hours as an integer and then use comparison operators to find the restaurants that are open during the specified time. Note that using dot notation for array indexing in aggregation pipelines may not work as expected, so we recommend using [\\$arrayElemAt](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/arrayElemAt/) operator.\n",
    "- You may assume that the open hour times are well formed, e.g. the format is HH:MM-HH:MM where HH represents the hour (from 0-23) and MM represents the minutes (from 0-59).\n",
    "- Your pipeline might need multiple steps to split the open hour, so take your time!"
